# 100Daysofcode
#Welcome to my journey of 100 days of coding 
##Everyday I will be updating what I learn that day here.

# Day 1
<p>Today I learned some basics in python like data types in python and about typecasting in python.
There are two types of typecasting in python </P>
1.Implicit typecasting
  conversion data types by program itself for e.g: 
  
```
  a=10
     b=2.0
     sum=a+b
     print(sum)
     #sum will be in float because of implicit typecasting
   
 ```
 
2. Explicit typecasting
  
<p>conversion of data types by programmer is called explicit typecasting .
  for e.g :</p>
  <break>
  
 ```
  a=10
     b=2
     sum=a+b
     print(float(sum))
     #sum is in integer and changed to float using explicit typecasting
 
  ```

# Day 2 
  
<p>Here in day 2 of codes I have learned about string slicing . String in python is similar to array .
  </p>

```
  
 name="Elephant"
 length=len(name) #this len function provides the length of name
 print(name[2:3]) #this print e
 print(name[1:5]) #this print leph
 #this above example is string slicing
  ```
  
# Greeting program
  <p>This program greet you according to your time .
    It import time from your computer using 
    
import time
    
#Then it convert time into string using
 
strftime()
    
    
After that greeting is done using elif codition as seen below :

### Match case statement 
    
 Match case is similar to switch case in c and c++ but there is no necesary of using break
    If you donot know about c and c++
    Match case is used to select case according to option here is a sample program:

### List
   
Is sequence data types in python that is a collection of sequence elements 
for e.g:
    
`lst=[1,2,56,"hari","alex",false]`
    
 Yes as you can see list can contains different data types.
    
 Tuples is also similar to list but it cannot be changed (i.e immutable)
 Clear explanation of list is shown below

 ### List method
  There are various method to perform with list that help in program some of them are:
  
  #### list.sort()
    
    It sort the list in ascending order

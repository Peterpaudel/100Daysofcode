# 100Daysofcode
#Welcome to my journey of 100 days of coding 
##Everyday I will be updating what I learn that day here.

# Day 1
<p>Today I learned some basics in python like data types in python and about typecasting in python.
There are two types of typecasting in python </P>
1.Implicit typecasting
  conversion data types by program itself for e.g: 
  
```
  a=10
     b=2.0
     sum=a+b
     print(sum)
     #sum will be in float because of implicit typecasting
   
 ```
 
2. Explicit typecasting
  
<p>conversion of data types by programmer is called explicit typecasting .
  for e.g :</p>
  <break>
  
 ```
  a=10
     b=2
     sum=a+b
     print(float(sum))
     #sum is in integer and changed to float using explicit typecasting
 
  ```

# Day 2 
  
<p>Here in day 2 of codes I have learned about string slicing . String in python is similar to array .
  </p>

```
  
 name="Elephant"
 length=len(name) #this len function provides the length of name
 print(name[2:3]) #this print e
 print(name[1:5]) #this print leph
 #this above example is string slicing
  ```
  
# Greeting program
  <p>This program greet you according to your time .
    It import time from your computer using  
```    
    import time
 ```   
    Then it convert time into string using
  ```  
    `strftime()`
  ```  
After that greeting is done using elif codition as seen below :

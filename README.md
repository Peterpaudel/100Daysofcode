# 100Daysofcode
#Welcome to my journey of 100 days of coding 
##Everyday I will be updating what I learn that day here.

# Day 1
<p>Today I learned some basics in python like data types in python and about typecasting in python.
There are two types of typecasting in python </P>
1.Implicit typecasting
  conversion data types by program itself for e.g: 
  ```
  a=10
     b=2.0
     sum=a+b
     print(sum)
     #sum will be in float because of implicit typecasting
     
 ```
2. Explicit typecasting
  <p>conversion of data types by programmer is called explicit typecasting .
  for e.g :</p>
  <break>
  ```a=10
     b=2
     sum=a+b
     print(float(sum))
     #sum is in integer and changed to float using explicit typecasting
